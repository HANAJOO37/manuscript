        <p id="summer">
            This past summer, I gave a lecture at a web conference and afterward got into a fascinating conversation 
            with a young digital design student. It was fun to compare where we were in our careers. I had fifteen years 
            of experience designing for web clients, she had one year, and yet some how, we were in the same 
            situation: we enjoyed the work, but were utterly confused and overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing 
            complexity of it all. What the hell happened? (That’s a rhetorical question, of course.)<br><br>
            It was a relief for both of us to mutually confess our frustration and confusion, and I began to wonder if this 
            situation was something to laugh off or take seriously. Neither of us had an answer, but a bit of time and 
            distance has shown me that we must do both. I’d like to extend that conversation today and attempt to 
            capture my perspective on that confusion and what it costs us.
        </p>
        <p id="absence">
            Absence was the primary source of my confusion. Three years ago, I stopped 
            making websites for clients to focus on Abstract, a software company I co-
            founded. My work there finished at the beginning of last year, and after a little 
            time off, I decided to reopen the design studio I was running beforehand.<br><br>
            And wouldn’t you know it? The first few jobs through the door were websites. 
            A lot can change in three years, so I decided to brush up on the latest 
            developments in how to best make websites… and oh my…
        </p>
        <p id="things">
            Things have gotten messy, haven’t they?
        </p>
        <p id="complexity">
            The complexity was off-putting at first. I was unsure if I even wanted tackle a 
            website after seeing the current working methods. Eventually, I agreed to the 
            projects. My gut told me that a lot of the new complexities in workflows, 
            toolchains, and development methods are completely optional for many 
            projects. That belief is the second thread of this talk: I’d like to make a modest 
            defense of simple design and implementation as a better option for the web 
            and the people who work there.<br><br>
            But, I am getting ahead of myself. First, I should tell you a bit more about who I 
            am and where I come from.
        </p>
        <div class="orange">
        <p class="center">
            I run a boutique design studio, which is a pretentious way of saying that it’s tiny with a capital-T. The studio 
            does all kinds of work: books, magazines, branding, and yes, of course, websites. This year is an anniversary. 
            The studio is celebrating 15 years in business, and I’m personally celebrating 20 years of making websites. 
            As with any big anniversary, you get sentimental about how things started.<br><br>
            The studio began in 2002 as a man (that’s me) with a laptop and a stack of paper at a desk in the corner of 
            his apartment.<br><br>
            Fifteen years later, the studio is still a man with a laptop and a stack of paper at a desk in the corner of his 
            apartment.<br><br>
            It’s difficult to fathom how much has changed around the studio in the last 15  years. Back then, there were 
            no social media as we know of them today—no Facebook, no Instagram, no snaps; most of the sites you 
            visit today did not exist back then, and most of the sites we visited then do not exist now. There were no 
            iPhones. You would go online to fetch directions and print out the map like a neanderthal. We were hitting 
            rocks together trying to make graphic design.<br><br>
            Everything is different now, but I am still at my desk.<br><br>
            At first I was bummed about my studio’s lack of visible progress, but then it hit me: what if I nailed it? Why 
            change if it’s working? I’ve been able to approach a lot of different projects from many different angles, and 
            I’m happy to report that I’ve gotten pretty good at a lot of it! Time and practice really do help.<br><br>
            Except with the websites. They separate themselves from the others, because I don’t feel much better at 
            making them after 20 years. My knowledge and skills develop a bit, then things change, and half of what I 
            know becomes dead weight. This hardly happens with any of the other work I do.<br><br>
            I wonder if I have twenty years of experience making websites, or if it is really five years of experience, 
            repeated four times. If you’ve been working in the technology industry a while, please tell me this sounds 
            familiar to you.

            Let me give you an example of these five year cycles.
        </th>
        <th id="said">
            As I said, I made my first website 20 years ago. I know this because I was a teenager doing 
            the Lord’s work: transcribing the lyrics to Radiohead’s OK Computer. It was 1997, I was learning 
            HTML, and there was one problem with the design that was confusing me: how do I put two 
            things next to each other?<br><br>
            Twenty years later, we’re still working out the answer to that very basic question.<br><br>
        <span class="tag">
        &lt;table&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&lt;tr&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td&gt;Hi&lt;/td&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;td&gt;Mom&lt;/td&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&lt;/tr&gt;<br>
        &lt;/table&gt;</span><br><br>
            Back in 1997, we used tables and spacer gifs. It was like designing a website in a spreadsheet 
            from hell. I found this process fun for some reason. Perhaps I was fascinated by the potential 
            of bashing together something in my room, hitting a button, then having it be “out there.”<br><br>
            <span class="tag">{ float: left; }</span><br>
            About five years later, websites moved to using floats in CSS because tables were not 
            semantic. Fair enough! Since then, I’ve spent about 200 hours reading about how to get floats 
            to clear. I’m still not sure I understand it; I type clear: both and say a prayer to the box model.<br><br>
            <span class="tag">{ display: flex; }</span><br>
            I was saved by Flexbox after five years of guess work. It is my baby. I was trained as a print 
            designer, and with flexbox, I can type 3 or 4 lines of CSS, and have two blocks of text line up at 
            the baseline. Hallelujah. I only needed to wait a decade to get this.<br><br>   
            <span class="tag">{ display: grid; }</span><br>
            And now, after flexing with flexbox, along comes CSS Grid: a powerful new feature that 
            promises to make responsive web design even more confusing. Of course, I am joking about 
            this, because Grid is a big improvement in controlling layout on the web. But it is a bit spooky 
            to sit down and learn more about it, because every time I see a diagram explaining how CSS 
            Grid works…<br><br>
            I’m reminded of the table layouts I was doing in 1997. I know Grid and Table layouts are 
            fundamentally different in their capabilities and approach, but that doesn’t stop me from 
            being unreasonable and irrational about their surface similarities. My lizard brain gets talking, 
            and it says we’re stuck in a loop and it’s repeating. We’ve completed a lap on a cycle which 
            will go around forever. Another approach for layout will come along five years from now. It will 
            probably resemble floats and not knowing how to clear a float will bite me in the ass for the 
            second time in my career.

            <p id="similar">
            There are similar examples of the cycle in other parts of how websites get designed and made. Nothing stays settled, so 
            of course a person with one year of experience and one with fifteen years of experience can both be confused. Things 
            are so often only understood by those who are well-positioned in the middle of the current wave of thought. If you’re 
            before the sweet spot in the wave, your inexperience means you know nothing. If you are after, you will know lots of things 
            that aren’t applicable to that particular way of doing things. I don’t bring this up to imply that the young are dumb or that 
            the inexperienced are inept—of course they’re not. But remember: if you stick around in the industry long enough, you’ll 
            get to feel all three situations.<br><br>
            One argument says that continual change in methodology is rigorous and healthy. I agree. Keeping things in play helps 
            us to more easily fix what’s wrong. It’d be terrible if nothing could ever change. But I also agree with the other argument: 
            people only have so much patience. How many laps around the cycle can a person run? I’m on lap five now, and I can 
            tell you that it is exhausting to engage with rehashed ideas from the past without feeling a tiny amount of prejudice 
            against them.<br><br>
            Methods that were once taboo are back on the table. For instance, last week I was reading a post about the benefits of 
            not using stylesheets and instead having inline styles for everything. The post made a few compelling points, but this 
            approach would have been crazy talk a few years ago.<br><br>
            So much of how we build websites and software comes down to how we think. The churn of tools, methods, and 
            abstractions also signify the replacement of ideology. A person must usually think in a way similar to the people who 
            created the tools to successfully use them. It’s not as simple as putting down a screwdriver and picking up a wrench. 
            A person needs to revise their whole frame of thinking; they must change their mind.<br><br>
            In one way, it is easier to be inexperienced: you don’t have to learn what is no longer relevant. Experience, on the other 
            hand, creates two distinct struggles: the first is to identify and unlearn what is no longer necessary (that’s work, too). 
            The second is to remain open-minded, patient, and willing to engage with what’s new, even if it resembles a new take on 
            something you decided against a long time ago.<br><br>
            That spirit of willingness was in me when I was investigating everything that had changed in the last 3 years. I started 
            with the best of intentions, but the more I learned, the grumpier I got. It seemed that most of the new methods involved 
            setting up elaborate systems to automate parts of the work. This is fine for particularly complicated and large projects, 
            but setting up the system and maintaining it seemed to be more effort for an experienced person on a small project 
            than doing the work without it.<br><br>
            The new methods were invented to manage a level of complexity that is completely foreign to me and my work. It was 
            easy to back away from most of this new stuff when I realized I have alternate ways of managing complexity. Instead of 
            changing my tools or workflow, I change my design. It’s like designing a house so it’s easy to build, instead of setting up 
            cranes typically used for skyscrapers.

        </div>
        <p id="directness">
            Directness is best in my experience, so a great photo, memorable illustration, or pitch-perfect sentence 
            does most of the work. Beyond that, fancy implementation has never moved the needle much for my 
            clients.<br><br>
            My web design philosophy is no razzle-dazzle. My job is to help my clients identify and express the one or 
            two uniquely true things about their project or company, then enhance it through a memorable design 
            with a light touch. If complexity comes along, we focus in on it, look for patterns, and change the blueprint 
            for what we’re building. We don’t necessarily go looking for better tools or fancier processes. In the past, I’ve 
            called this following the grain of the web, which is to use design choices that swing with what HTML, CSS, 
            and screens make easy, flexible, and resilient.<br><br>
            It seems there are fewer and fewer notable websites built with this approach each year. So, I thought it 
            would be useful to remind everyone that the easiest and cheapest strategy for dealing with complexity is 
            not to invent something to manage it, but to avoid the complexity altogether with a more clever plan. 
            To test how much complexity comes along with my limited needs, I wrote down the technical requirements 
            of my web design practice. It’s not a long list:
        </p>
        <table id="seta">
        <th id="first"></th>
        <th id="simple">
            simple, responsive layout web fonts and nicely set text performant, scalable images
        </th>
        <th id="all">
            All of these have been more than met for at least five years, but 
            the complexity of even these very fundamental needs has 
            ballooned in the last few years.<br><br>
            For instance, I just showed you four different methods to put two 
            things next to each other. Each new method mostly replaces the 
            last, so hopefully we’re reaching a stabilization point with flexbox 
            and CSS Grid. But who knows what will come out five years from now?<br><br>
            Webfonts? I thought we could jot down a few lines with @font-
            face, but A Book Apart just published a 90 page e-book on how to 
            load those fonts. This is totally surprising to me: I thought 
            implementing webfonts was a relatively easy procedure, but I 
            guess not!<br><br>
            Even images are now complicated. Vector images get served as 
            SVGs, but digging deep into this can make you go cross-eyed, 
            because an SVG is essentially another web page to embed in 
            your webpage. And with raster, the need to send along the best-
            sized image for the right device is complicated enough that paid 
            services have come along to manage this for you. Serving an 
            image is now as complicated as serving a video.

            My point is that the foundations are now sufficiently complicated enough on their own that it seems foolish 
            to go add more optional complexity on top of it. I’ve kept my examples to the most basic of web 
            implementations, and I haven’t touched on Javascript, animation, libraries, frameworks, pre-processors, 
            package managers, automation, testing, or deployment. Whew.<br><br>

            All of that bundled together is the popular way to work in 2018. But other people’s toolchains are absolutely 
            inscrutable from the outside. Even getting started is touchy. Last month, I had to install a package manager 
            to install a package manager. That’s when I closed my laptop and slowly backed away from it. We’re a long 
            way from the CSS Zen Garden where I started.<br><br>
            If you go talk to a senior software developer, you’ll probably hear them complain about spaghetti code. 
            This is when code is overwrought, unorganized, opaque, and snarled with dependencies. I perked up when I 
            heard the term used for the first time, because, while I can’t identify spaghetti code as a designer, I sure as 
            hell know about spaghetti workflows and spaghetti toolchains. It feels like we’re there now on the web.<br><br>
            That breaks my heart, because so much of my start on the web came from being able to see and easily 
            make sense of any site I’d visit. I had view source, but each year that goes by, it becomes less and less 
            helpful as a way to investigate other people’s work. Markup balloons in size and becomes illegible because 
            computers are generating it without an eye for context. Styles become overly verbose and redundant to 
            the point of confusion. Functionality gets obfuscated behind compressed Javascript.<br><br>
            This situation is annoying to me, because my thoughts turn to that young designer I mentioned at the start 
            of my talk. How many opportunities did I have to reproduce what I saw by having legible examples in front 
            of me? And how detrimental is it to have that kind of information obfuscated for her? Before, the websites 
            could explain themselves; now, someone needs to walk you through it.<br><br>
            Illegibility comes from complexity without clarity. I believe that the legibility of the source is one of the most 
            important properties of the web. It’s the main thing that keeps the door open to independent, unmediated 
            contributions to the network. If you can write markup, you don’t need Medium or Twitter or Instagram 
            (though they’re nice to have). And the best way to help someone write markup is to make sure they can 
            read markup.<br><br>
            I wonder what young designers think of this situation and how they are educating themselves in a 
            complicated field. How do they learn if the code is illegible? Does it seem like more experienced people are 
            pulling up the ladder of opportunity by doing this? Twenty years ago, I decided to make my own website, 
            because I saw an example of HTML and I could read it. Many of my design peers are the same. We possess 
            skills to make websites, but we stopped there. We stuck with markup and never progressed into full-on 
            programming, because we were only willing to go as far as things were legible.<br><br>
            If knowledge about the web deteriorates quickly, it’s worthwhile to develop a solid personal philosophy 
            toward change and learning.<br><br>
            Silicon Valley has tried to provide a few of these. All are about speed. The most famous comes from 
            Facebook, with their “Move fast and break things” mantra. This phrase has been thrown under the bus 
            enough times by now, but it is interesting that so few are willing to commit to its opposite: “Go slow and fix 
            things.”

            This has been my favorite internet discovery of the last few 
            months. I’ve watched it enough times to overthink it. See, the 
            rabbit doesn’t lose because he gets tired. He loses because he 
            gets confused about which direction to go. Did you notice how it 
            stops in the middle and stares blankly as everyone around it yells 
            loudly about things it doesn’t understand? That’s me on Twitter.<br><br>
            As someone who has decades of experience on the web, I hate to 
            compare myself to the tortoise, but hey, if it fits, it fits. Let’s be 
            more like that tortoise: diligent, direct, and purposeful. The web 
            needs pockets of slowness and thoughtfulness as its reach and 
            power continues to increase. What we depend upon must be 
            properly built and intelligently formed. We need to create space 
            for complexity’s important sibling: nuance. Spaces without 
            nuance tend to gravitate towards stupidity. And as an American, I 
            can tell you, there are no limits to the amount of damage that can be inflicted by that dangerous cocktail 
            </th>
            <th id="can">
            by that dangerous cocktail of fast-moving-stupid.<br><br>
            The web also needs diligent people so that the idea of what the 
            web is and what it does remains legible to everyone. This applies 
            to being able to read the systems and social environments the 
            web creates so we know what’s real and what’s not, but the call 
            for legibility should also humbly apply to writing legible code and 
            designs systems that are easy for nearly anyone to interpret 
            thanks to their elegance. That important work has a place, too.<br><br>
            It’s by keeping our work legible that we keep the door open to the 
            next generation of our co-workers. What works for them also 
            works for us, because whether you are just out of school or have 
            twenty years of experience, you’ll eventually end up in the same 
            spot: your first year of making websites.

            Frank Chimero, a designer from Brooklyn, New York, gave a talk called 'Everything Easy is Hard Again' at two 
            conferences, one in Portugal in October 2017, and another in Berlin in February 2018. In his talk, he talked 
            about how making websites has become more complicated.<br><br>
            He started by mentioning a conversation he had with a young design student. They both felt confused by 
            the complex nature of web design, even though he had 15 years of experience and. He found it 
            overwhelming to catch up with all the changes in how websites are made. 
            Chimero talked about how web design keeps changing every five years. For example, how we used to 
            make website layouts with tables, then with floats, then with Flexbox, and now with CSS Grid. He also 
            mentioned that even simple things like using web fonts or images have become more complex. 
            He believes that keeping things simple is a good approach. He thinks many of the new complexities in web 
            design are not needed for most projects. Chimero is worried that because of all this complexity, websites 
            are becoming harder to understand. He thinks it's important to keep websites easy to read and 
            understand, especially for people who are new to web design.<br><br>
            In the end, he suggests that we should slow down and think more when we make websites. He says we 
            need to keep things clear and not make them too complicated. This way, the web can stay accessible for 
            everyone, including future generations.

            The reading fits into the canon of design because it talks about how web 
            design is changing and how it affects designers. It shows that designers have a 
            hard time with the new complexities. Even though it's about web design, it also 
            presents ideas that can apply to design in general, emphasizing the 
            importance of keeping things simple.

            The author does a good job of showing how designers feel when they find web 
            design is getting too hard. He also explains well why it's essential to keep things 
            simple.

            Although the author feels web design is getting harder, it might be because 
            web design is solving more complicated issues. You see, as web design 
            improves, more people want complex stuff.

            The reading says that in design, we should make things simple, easy to read, 
            and open to change. Designers should have a clear goal and avoid making 
            things too complicated. It also recommends that designers should follow the 
            web's natural ways and be straightforward.
